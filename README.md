Alexandria (provisional name) should be a simple app that let's you enter bibliographic data of academic sources and creates a naked TXT-file bibliography.

Aimed at academic public.

Collaborators welcome.

Ideas:

– simple python GUI (or other language) with only basic fields (author, publication name, page, volume, year, editor, location) – independent from Harvard or MLA formats and the like – easy to use (and change) – lightweight – independent from other expensive bibliography software and those complex software tools

WHY?

– It is much easier to simply type in a source than get the data from a platform or database which is in most cases full of mistakes – No one needs all the complex functions of Citavi and the other state-of-the-art solutions
